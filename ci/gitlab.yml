# Variables that can be set to control the behaviour of
# pipelines that are run
#
#  - RUN_ALL_CONTAINERS - build all containers
#    even if they don't have any changes detected
#
# These can be set as git push options
#
#  $ git push -o ci.variable=RUN_ALL_CONTAINERS=1
#
# Aliases can be set for common usage
#
#  $ git config --local alias.push-all-ctr "push -o ci.variable=RUN_ALL_CONTAINERS=1"
#
# Allowing the less verbose invokation
#
#  $ git push-all-ctr
#
# Pipeline variables can also be set in the repository
# pipeline config globally, or set against scheduled pipelines
